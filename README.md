# Forcasting_sunspots
## About
The sunspot cycle is one of the greatest mysteries in the study of Solar Physics. 
If we could predict the sunspot cycle, we can know about a lot of classified information regarding the Sun,
such as how its internal magnetic field is generated and so on. To achieve this, neural network has been put to work.

## Estimation
The duration of solar spot cycle is 11 or 22 years(Depending upon the source). Here since it is a seasonal(repetitive) hence machine learning techniques using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide) to predict upcoming solar activity.Data is used to train the neural network and we find hyperparameters which give least Mean Absolute Error(MAE)
